# Web Calculator

This is a simple calculator project implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. Below is a readme describing the structure and functionality of the code.

## Files and Structure

- **index.html**: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the calculator interface and includes necessary CSS and JavaScript files.

- **index.css**: This CSS file contains the styles for the calculator interface.

- **index.js**: This JavaScript file contains the logic for the calculator operations.

## Calculator Interface

The calculator interface is built using Bootstrap 4.1.3 for styling and consists of a display section and a set of buttons for digits, arithmetic operators, and control functions.

- **Display**: The display section shows the current value of the calculator and any error messages.

- **Buttons**: The buttons represent digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), decimal point (.), backspace (&lt;), reset, and equals (=).

## JavaScript Functions

- **getValue**: This function is called when a digit, decimal point, or arithmetic operator button is clicked. It appends the corresponding value to the display.

- **handleDelete**: This function is called when the backspace button (&lt;) is clicked. It removes the last character from the display.

- **handleReset**: This function is called when the reset button is clicked. It resets the display to 0.

- **getResult**: This function is called when the equals button (=) is clicked. It evaluates the mathematical expression entered and displays the result.

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to use the calculator. Click the buttons to input digits and perform arithmetic operations. The display will show the current input and the result of the calculation.

Feel free to modify the code, styles, or functionality to suit your needs and preferences.
